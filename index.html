        Three newly-trained web developers share with you a set of warnings to
        avoid web development as a career choice all together, at all cost. Read
        carefully and don’t even think about falling into the trap.

          Coding is dangerous. You probably think that it is the pathway to a
          better set of opportunities in the job market with a relatively high
          income and even to solve some of the world’s biggest problems. This
          article is intended to warn anyone who might be interested in becoming
          or already is on their way to become a web developer, that it is never
          too late to desist from this egregious idea. Learning to program is a
          long, winding path characterized by the utmost struggle.

        <h4>Documentation: friend or foe?</h4>
        <p>
          Many a coder will assure any newbie that the reason documentation has
          been invented and continues to be updated is to provide help to solve
          any coding issue that could arise. In fact, the first rule of WebDev
          is to look into the documentation. Welp! Good luck not getting lost in
          it! Trying to find anything in any documentation is a long, torturous
          process that often times leaves you more confused about a problem than
          when you started.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          Of course, learning to navigate documentation is an exercise only
          mastered through repetition and perseverance. Well we got news for
          you: by the time you finally think you mastered any part of it, a new
          version appears or some part of it gets deprecated or becomes
          obsolete. Updates and new platforms or technologies are extremely
          annoying. So it is better not to bother.

        <h4>Life-long learning: the never-ending doom</h4>
        <p>
          Acquiring the skill of coding is hard. Very hard. You have doomed
          yourself into a life of never-ending learning. You have to constantly
          master a new language, a new technology, a new version of a library.
          Your brain will need to undergo constant training to the point that
          you may become too smart because you have to learn more in one week
          than what you learned in 10 years of school. You are basically a
          hamster on a wheel now. Forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning web development will certainly give you a new perspective on
          life. Remember how you used to be a cheerful little bugger who
          believed anything was possible? Anything is indeed possible once you
          decide to learn to code. Kiss that lovely sense of hope and purpose
          goodbye.Your entire life will suffer: your professional prospects will
          change fundamentally, your mental health will be in constant peril,
          your physical health will deteriorate, and your social life will
          certainly take a turn.

        <h4>Web Development: A new Path in life?</h4>
        <p>
          As a developer, you need to learn how to debug and how to approach a
          problem. There is just no way around it. Except nobody will tell you
          just how annoying debugging or how long the process of solving a
          problem is. For instance, it is common knowledge that there are many
          coding challenges that are quite popular, like the renowned Fibonacci
          Sequence, which is often part of an interview process.

          Once you have spent a week trying to solve it without any success, you
          will lose faith that you will ever be able to unlock that achievement.
          In fact, you will lose faith that it can even be solved by average
          minds (like yours). The first of a series of meltdowns/mental
          breakdowns ensues to the point that you start questioning all of your
          life choices. This basically entails having unlocked a pathway into a
          whole new series of existential crises.

        <h4>Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno</h4>
        <p>
          Community is the cornerstone of the technologies that we use and
          develop. As a developer, you will not navigate any of these challenges
          alone. You will certainly meet new people, and possibly make too many
          new friends, because you will have no choice but to make friends with
          other programers. After a while, they will be the only ones to laugh
          about your jokes because they will be the only ones to understand
          them. Get ready to buy a whole lot of presents for people outside of
          your non-existent inner circle, like for Christmas, or Chanukkah, or
          Eid, or Chinese New Year, or Kwanza, or Day of the Dead, or Diwali, or
          Summer Solstice, or St. Patrick’s Day, or all of these but not for
          Valentine’s day.

        <h4>Communication is Key</h4>

        <p>
          A sturdy, loving relationship with your partner or family or dog or
          cat or plant will turn into a fantasy you no longer care enough to
          nurture. The thrill of building something new is so intense that you
          will neglect your non-screen relationships. You will no longer be able
          to put two coherent sentences together. Speaking like a normal human
          being to maintain good communication that is grounded in empathy and
          active listening will be out the window before you can say fibonacci.
          Indeed, once you really get into coding, you may be able to forget all
          about your little broken heart, because you will no longer feel
          anything other than the dopamine hit of making something work or the
          soothing rage of finding out where that god-forsaken semicolon was
          missing. If you are a perfectionist, coding will be the most
          triggering experience of your life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mark of a good web developer is perseverance. Giving up is not an
          option and your resilience will be put to the test on the daily. You
          may be able to regain some of those communication skills with the
          myriad of debugging ducks that will probably colonize your entire
          apartment. Therefore, caring for your physical and mental health must
          become your top priority. A well rested mind will be able to code
          better, except for the fact that bugs in your code will decide whether
          you got to bed at all or even are able to fall asleep. And if you do,
          guess what you will dream about.

        <p>
          Your physical health will suffer. You will grow a humpback from
          hunching over your computer. Your lower back will get so tight that
          you might want to consider creating diamonds with all that juicy
          pressure you have single-handedly created. Dehydration is a real
          threat you will have to grapple with once you start forgetting to take
          fluids. Your skin will turn a pasty hue due to the lack of sun or real
          nutrients in your diet, because your eating habits will also change.
          You will not have the time to invest in feeding yourself properly, so
          you will either forget to eat or eat just about anything. Kiss that
          scrumptious little figure of yours goodbye, Sally! You will get either
          extra fat or extra skinny. Either way, you will become super
          unattractive and you will die alone, as we already covered that
          earlier in this article.
        </p>

          Alternatively, you will need someone to feed and care of you. It’s
          time to rely on what could be left of your inner circle (if there is
          anyone left in that wasteland). Let yourself be parented by your
          partner or even your own mother at 34 years old, thus falling into
          toxic relationship patterns that will lead to nothing but mutual
          resentment. If you live alone, then eat your cat. Or your plant.

        <h4>It’s not all bad…</h4>
        <p>
          By this point you have noticed the tone of this article may evoke one
          of despair, but let us assure you that there is great joy in learning
          how to code your own web application. In fact, you can almost
          certainly count on joy being the main driver of this new endeavor of
          yours. As mentioned above, the dopamine hit of solving a problem or
          debugging your code or making something work is very addictive.
          Dopamine will become your new drug of choice. It makes you so happy
          that you forget just how exhausting it was getting there in the first
          place. Only to hit rock bottom ever so often that you go back for
          another hit before you know it. Congratulations, you have chosen the
          path of a junkie.

        <h4>Coding: a super power</h4>
        <p>
          Suddenly, you will feel so powerful that you will start thinking that
          all the problems of the world could be resolved by coding. Being
          regarded as a hero (mainly by yourself) will become terribly annoying.
          Traveling the world will become a real possibility because you can
          work remotely and your skills are so transferable that you could code
          from anywhere.

          Seriously, stop pursuing web development as a career path. It will
          mess you up. It will show you all the possibilities of your creativity
          and problem-solving skills. You don’t want that. And the worst part is
          that you have no one to blame but your miserable self. You have been
          thoroughly and fairly warned. Whatever you do, cross web development
          off of your career choices.
